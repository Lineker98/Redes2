Here, Receiver is a class that represents the receiving end of a TCP connection. 
It takes a window_size argument, which is the maximum number of unacknowledged packets that 
the sender can have in flight at any given time.

The receive method is called whenever a new packet is received. It takes two arguments: 
data, which is the payload of the packet, and seq_num, which is the sequence number of the packet.

The receive method adds the packet to a buffer and sorts the buffer by sequence number. 
It then checks if it can move the window forward by delivering any data to the application 
layer that has been received in order. It does this by checking the sequence number of the first 
packet in the buffer. If it is equal to the expected sequence number (next_seq_num), the data is 
delivered to the application layer, the packet is removed from the buffer, and the window is moved 
forward. This process is repeated until the first packet in the buffer has a sequence number that is 
not equal to next_seq_num.
, if the window size is a multiple of window_size, the receiver can increase the window size by 
doubling it.

Note that this is a simplified implementation of the sliding window algorithm, and it may not be suitable 
for all use cases. It also assumes that packets are received in order, which may not always be the case 
in practice.
